This is a work in progress.

The intent of this RestModel implementation for Sencha Touch based applications
is to provide a way of sending small datasets using Rest.  When a specific
piece of information is requested and a 'uri' field is set, it will attempt
to auto-populate the rest of the fields in the store.
