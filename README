The intent of this RestModel implementation for Sencha Touch based applications
is to provide a way of sending small datasets using Rest.  When a specific
piece of information is requested and a 'uri' field is set, it will attempt
to auto-populate the rest of the fields in the store.

In many situations a Restful service will return a link to another resource.  In
this implementation, when a URI is defined as a part of the model, it will leverage
that URI to populate the entirety of that store.

For example, a simple model like a Car may look like this.

Model = [
    year
    model
    make,
    color,
    transmission
]

The initial request for data may return the following,

Record = [
    model,
    make,
    uri
]

Now there are three other properties that have not been included but a URI parameter
specified which indicates, there is more information.  Instead of creating a new
store and model, execute the method "expand()" on the model.  The data will be
fetched from the URI and populated into the data element of the model.  This would
result in the following.

Record = [
    year
    model
    make,
    color,
    transmission,
    uri (optional)
]

The uri is option here.  It can be returned by the Restful service or left out.  
The model is smart enough to determine that the model has already been expanded and
will not attempt to expand the model after the first expansion.
